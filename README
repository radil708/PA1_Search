This repo contains my solutions to the pacman project 1 search as listed in: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp22/project1/#question-7-4-points-eating-all-the-dots

In it, I implemented the following search algorithms DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*

I also designed/defined some heuristics and goal states for certain problems as listed in the prompt
